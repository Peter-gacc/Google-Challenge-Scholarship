			<p>Cheetah is the fastset animal known to live on the land.
				It belongs to the cat family but amazingly, it is vey fast, unlike
				the pets we have. It feeds mostly on small antelope and
				young of larger animals-Warthog, Kudu, Hartebeest, Oryx. Cheetah
				are among the indangered species and we need
				to act fast to save them from extinction</p>
